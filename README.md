# Email Classification


This project aims to classify an email under one of two classes (Spam (1) or Not Spam (0)). I exploited Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in order to extract meangiful features from the text data. 

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
```
pip install pandas 
pip install Numpy
pip install Sci-kit Learn
pip install Plotly
pip install NLTK
pip install 
```

## Dataset
We use/ analyse data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/bagavathypriya/email-spam-dataset) in this project , it is a labeld dataset contains Email messages, each messagae is labeled by the category of the message wether it is a spam or not. 

## Build With

* [ETL Pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) - For data visualaziation, processing and preparation.
* [Sklearn Pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) - to build a pipeline of machine learning 
* [Naive Bayes](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html) - an machine learning model for text classification

# Folders and Files
This repository includes:

* **Jupyter_Notebook** Two notebook files inlcuding ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) Pipeline notebook and ML pipeline notebook.
* **data** Where you the data is uploaded and processed.
